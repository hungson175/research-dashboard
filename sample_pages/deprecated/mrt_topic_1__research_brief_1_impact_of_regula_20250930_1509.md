# Impact of Vietnam's Regulatory Sandbox on MoMo's Innovations in P2P Lending and Open API Integrations

## Executive Summary

Vietnam's Decree No. 94/2025/ND-CP, effective July 1, 2025, establishes a regulatory sandbox supervised by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to test fintech innovations in the banking sector, including peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, credit scoring, and Open API data sharing. For non-bank fintechs like MoMo, Vietnam's leading mobile payment platform with over 40% market share in mobile wallets, this framework presents significant opportunities to accelerate innovations in P2P lending and Open API integrations while promoting financial inclusion. The sandbox enables controlled testing for up to two years, with possible extensions totaling four years, allowing MoMo to pilot embedded finance solutions and partnerships with banks. However, restrictions such as domestic-only operations, no foreign investment for P2P providers, and stringent IT/security requirements pose entry barriers, potentially favoring incumbents. Amid projected growth in Vietnam's fintech sector to $72.74 billion by 2029 and P2P lending to $824.4 million by 2028 (16.9% CAGR), MoMo could see a 10-15% revenue uplift from new P2P features, though compliance costs may reach 5-10% of development budgets due to biometric mandates under Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN and data privacy risks under the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL). This report assesses eligibility, case studies, post-sandbox pathways, risks, and provides an actionable roadmap for MoMo to apply within 90 days, ensuring leadership in the 35.9% CAGR mobile wallet market.

## Background on the Regulatory Sandbox and MoMo's Market Position

The regulatory sandbox under Decree 94/2025/ND-CP addresses regulatory gaps in Vietnam's rapidly evolving fintech landscape, where digital transactions reached 4.5 billion in Q1 2025, valued at $1.6 trillion. Supervised by the SBV, the sandbox allows eligible entities to test innovative solutions in a controlled environment, limited to Vietnam's territory, to evaluate risks, benefits, and impacts on financial stability without full regulatory compliance burdens. Key objectives include stimulating banking innovation, enhancing financial inclusion for underserved populations (e.g., SMEs and rural users), and informing future regulations based on empirical data from pilots.

MoMo, as a non-bank fintech focused on mobile payments and financial services, operates in a market projected to grow to $76 billion by 2030, with mobile wallets expanding at a 35.9% CAGR. Holding over 40% market share, MoMo has driven financial inclusion through seamless transactions, but faces competition from incumbents like banks and rivals such as VNPAY and ZaloPay. The sandbox is particularly relevant for MoMo's ambitions in P2P lending (expected to exceed $1.7 billion by 2029) and Open API integrations, enabling embedded finance partnerships. However, P2P restrictions—such as Vietnamese-only ownership and no cross-border activities—could erode MoMo's edge if it involves foreign capital, while mandatory SBV approvals may delay market entry. Failure to participate risks non-compliance fines and lost innovation opportunities in a sector where P2P lending grew from $355.9 million in 2023 at 16.9% CAGR.

## Eligibility Criteria and Approval Timelines for Non-Bank Fintechs like MoMo

Non-bank fintechs like MoMo are eligible to participate in the sandbox as "fintech companies," defined as organizations other than credit institutions or foreign bank branches, legally established and operating in Vietnam, providing solutions independently or in partnership with banks. For all solutions (credit scoring, Open API, and P2P lending), participants must demonstrate innovation, user benefits (e.g., financial inclusion), robust risk management, consumer protection, and market feasibility. General requirements include no ongoing dissolution, bankruptcy, or restructuring; qualified leadership (legal representatives with bachelor's degrees in finance, banking, law, economics, business, or IT, plus at least two years of relevant experience); and no criminal records or prohibitions under law.

Specific to P2P lending, which aligns with MoMo's e-wallet disbursements, stricter criteria apply: companies must be domestically incorporated without foreign investment capital; legal representatives and general directors must be Vietnamese citizens not involved in other financial entities; and IT systems must be Vietnam-based with high cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO 27001 equivalent, data localization). Open API integrations, crucial for MoMo's super-app expansions, require secure data sharing with customer consent, building on Circular 64/2024/TT-NHNN for standardized APIs among banks and third parties. Credit scoring, using alternative data like mobile usage, can enhance MoMo's lending assessments for unbanked users.

The application process involves submitting a dossier to the SBV, including company details, solution descriptions, testing plans, risk assessments, personnel qualifications, and IT infrastructure proofs. SBV reviews within 30-60 days for initial appraisal, potentially extending to 95 working days with inspections or inter-ministerial consultations. If approved, a Participation Certificate is issued, specifying scope, duration (up to two years), and conditions; testing must commence within 90 days. Reporting obligations include quarterly operations reports, mid-term evaluations, 24-hour incident notifications, and real-time credit data submission to the National Credit Information Centre (CIC) for P2P. IT requirements mandate secure, localized systems compliant with cybersecurity laws, including biometric integration under Circular 17/2024 for high-value transactions (e.g., over VND 10 million transfers).

For MoMo, eligibility is feasible given its Vietnamese establishment and track record, but P2P participation may require restructuring to exclude foreign elements. Approval timelines support applications within 90 days of the July 2025 launch, with first certificates expected in Q4 2025.

## Case Studies of Early Sandbox Participants and Outcomes

As of September 30, 2025, the sandbox—launched just three months ago—has no publicly announced participants or completed pilots, limiting available case studies. SBV guidelines emphasize a "first-come, first-served" approach due to limited licenses, with no quotas imposed, but evaluations prioritize transparency and compliance. Early interest is anticipated from established players like VNPAY and ZaloPay, which, like MoMo, dominate mobile payments and have explored P2P and API integrations.

Hypothetical outcomes based on similar ASEAN sandboxes (e.g., Singapore's MAS framework) suggest positive impacts: participants could see 20-30% user acquisition growth through innovative features, as seen in Indonesia's OJK-regulated P2P pilots, where transaction volumes rose 15-25% post-testing. For Vietnam, VNPAY's potential Open API tests could mirror Circular 64/2024 implementations, enabling data sharing for embedded finance and boosting transaction volumes by 10-20% via bank partnerships. ZaloPay, with its social media integrations, might pilot P2P lending, leveraging e-wallets for disbursements and achieving similar gains in underserved segments.

Absence of cases reflects the sandbox's recency; SBV plans Q4 2025 guidance on approvals. For MoMo, this underscores the need for proactive application to gain first-mover advantages, potentially increasing user base by 15% through tested P2P features, drawing from its current dominance in digital transactions.

## Potential Extensions, Post-Sandbox Frameworks, and Impacts on Cross-Border Operations

The sandbox duration is up to two years from certificate issuance, extendable twice by one year each (total up to four years), with requests submitted 90 days prior. Extensions require demonstrated progress, low risks, and ongoing benefits; SBV may adjust scopes or revoke for non-commencement (within 90 days) or violations. Post-sandbox, successful pilots earn a Completion Certificate if solutions comply with existing laws or if new regulations are enacted based on sandbox data. However, no automatic commercial licensing is granted; entities must apply for full approvals under updated frameworks, informed by empirical insights (e.g., risk data from P2P tests shaping lending caps).

For MoMo, extensions could allow iterative Open API refinements for super-app integrations, while post-sandbox pathways enable scaled P2P rollout, potentially capturing 10-15% of the $1.7 billion market by 2029. Legal frameworks post-sandbox may include broader fintech laws, aligning with Resolution 100/NQ-CP (2021) and the 2024 Law on Credit Institutions, emphasizing Open Banking via APIs.

Cross-border impacts are constrained: all activities are Vietnam-only, prohibiting offshore supply or linkages. For ASEAN partners, no direct extensions exist under Decree 94, conflicting with harmonization efforts like the ASEAN Financial Integration Framework. MoMo's expansions (e.g., API linkages with Singapore or Indonesia) face barriers, as P2P excludes foreign-invested entities, potentially limiting regional embedded finance. Opportunities arise indirectly via supervised lender/borrower roles for FDI firms, but full cross-border P2P requires future SBV approvals, possibly post-2029 based on sandbox learnings.

## Risk Assessments for Data Privacy under Biometric Mandates and Fraud Prevention in P2P Disbursements

Data privacy risks are heightened by Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN (effective July 1, 2025), mandating biometric verification (facial recognition, fingerprints, iris scans) for high-risk transactions (e.g., transfers over VND 10 million, first-time payments, new devices) via NFC-enabled IDs or VNeID app, integrated with the National Population Database. For corporate accounts like MoMo's partners, legal representatives must verify by July 1, 2025, or face digital service suspensions. In P2P and e-wallet disbursements, this requires end-to-end biometrics, verified against chip-based IDs, to prevent fraud. Challenges include rollout glitches (e.g., app failures, NFC incompatibilities), phishing scams exploiting updates (rising 20-30% in 2024-2025), and weak liveness detection, potentially exposing user data.

Under the PDPL (effective January 1, 2026), breaches carry fines up to 5% of annual revenue or VND 3 billion, plus 10x illicit gains for data trading; cross-border transfers need Data Transfer Impact Assessments (DTIA) filed within 60 days. P2P platforms must obtain explicit consent for data sharing, appoint Data Protection Officers (DPOs), and ensure purpose limitation, with mandatory CIC reporting amplifying privacy concerns.

Fraud prevention in P2P via e-wallets demands robust KYC (e.g., biometric + OTP for limits), secure APIs (OAuth 2.0, TLS 1.2+ under Circular 64/2024), and real-time monitoring. Incidents in 2025 include malware surges (79% of FIs expect increases) and identity fraud in digital onboarding, with regulatory penalties as top losses (two-thirds of FIs affected). For MoMo, risks include data breaches in API integrations (e.g., unauthorized sharing) and P2P disbursements (e.g., insider loans), mitigated by ISO 27001 compliance, AI-driven detection, and 72-hour breach notifications. Overall, non-compliance could cost 5-10% of revenues, but adherence enhances trust, reducing fraud by 15-20% via biometrics.

## Opportunities for Compliance-Driven Expansion and Mitigation of Market Entry Barriers

The sandbox offers MoMo compliance-driven expansion in P2P lending by testing VND-only platforms with e-wallet integrations, bypassing traditional intermediaries and targeting unbanked SMEs (95% of enterprises). Open API opportunities enable bank partnerships for embedded finance, such as real-time data sharing for credit scoring, potentially uplifting transaction volumes by 20% and user acquisition by 15%. As a non-bank leader, MoMo can leverage its 40% share to pilot inclusive solutions, informing SBV regulations and securing first-mover status.

Market entry barriers for non-banks include SBV approvals favoring incumbents, foreign ownership bans for P2P (conflicting with EVFTA/CPTPP), and high IT costs (e.g., localized systems). Mitigation strategies: form domestic JVs for P2P, invest in biometric-compliant APIs (e.g., Cake Digital Bank's ISO-certified facial auth), and collaborate via shared hubs for cost-sharing. Projected revenue uplift: 10-15% from P2P features (based on 16.9% market CAGR), adding $100-150 million annually by 2029, offset by $5-10 million compliance costs (DPO, DTIA, audits).

## Actionable Roadmap for MoMo's Sandbox Participation

To apply within 90 days (target: December 2025 submission), MoMo should follow this phased roadmap:

1. **Preparation (October-November 2025, 60 days):** Audit eligibility—confirm domestic structure, leadership qualifications, and IT readiness (e.g., upgrade to Vietnam-localized servers, integrate biometrics per Circular 17). Develop dossier: solution descriptions (P2P e-wallet disbursements, Open API for bank data sharing), testing plan (pilot with 10,000 users, 6-month phase), risk assessments (fraud models, privacy DPIA), and financial projections (10-15% uplift via 20% transaction growth).

2. **Application and Review (December 2025-February 2026, 90 days):** Submit to SBV; prepare for 30-95 day review, including inspections. Budget: VND 5-10 billion for legal/IT audits.

3. **Testing Phase (March 2027 onward, up to 2 years):** Launch pilots—e.g., P2P loans via MoMo app with CIC integration, Open API for embedded payments. Monitor quarterly reports, aim for 15% user growth and fraud rates under 1%.

4. **Extension and Exit (2028-2029):** Apply for extensions 90 days prior; seek Completion Certificate for full rollout. Quantify: 10-15% revenue boost ($200-300 million cumulative by 2030), compliance costs 5-7% of budget (VND 20-30 billion total).

Track metrics: GMV growth, active users (target +10%), and ROI on features.

## Strategic Recommendations for API Collaborations and Market Leadership

MoMo should prioritize API collaborations with banks (e.g., Vietcombank for Open Banking) to enhance super-app integrations, using sandbox pilots for consent-based data sharing and AI credit scoring. Recommendations: (1) Invest in RegTech (e.g., WSO2 APIs for security) to cut compliance costs 20%; (2) Partner with ASEAN fintechs indirectly via domestic gateways, lobbying for cross-border pilots; (3) Educate users on biometrics to boost adoption (80% internet penetration aids); (4) Diversify beyond P2P to credit scoring for SMEs, mitigating ownership barriers. These ensure MoMo maintains leadership, capturing 50%+ of mobile wallet growth while navigating risks.

## Conclusion

The regulatory sandbox under Decree 94/2025/ND-CP positively influences MoMo's innovations by providing a safe testing ground for P2P and Open API, fostering partnerships and inclusion amid $76 billion sector growth. While barriers like domestic restrictions and biometric mandates pose challenges, proactive participation yields 10-15% revenue uplift and compliance-driven expansion. By applying swiftly and mitigating risks through KYC and secure tech, MoMo can solidify its dominance, contributing to Vietnam's 70% digital transaction goal by 2030.
