# Adoption of AI and Biometric Security in Fraud Prevention and User Trust: Implications for MoMo in Vietnam's Fintech Landscape

## Executive Summary

Vietnam's fintech market is projected to reach $15.4 billion in 2025, growing at a CAGR of 17.8% through 2034, driven by digital payments and mobile wallets amid a regional mobile payments volume expected to hit $475 billion by 2027 [1]. However, cyber-fraud poses a significant restraint, with losses exceeding VND 18.9 trillion ($742.63 million) in 2024, impacting market growth by up to -1.3% and exacerbating challenges for the 290 million unbanked in Southeast Asia, particularly in rural areas with low financial literacy (-0.9% impact) [2]. Regulations like Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN and the July 2025 magnetic stripe ban mandate biometric verification for corporate accounts and high-risk transactions, aligning with SBV's cybersecurity priorities under Decision 2345/QD-NHNN [3]. Integrating AI-driven fraud detection with biometrics, as seen in MoMo's partnership with iProov, can reduce fraud by 40-72%, yield 7-9% cost savings, and drive 9% revenue growth by 2027, enhancing user trust and retention [4]. This report analyzes these integrations, forecasts risk reductions, and provides an implementation framework for MoMo, ensuring compliance and long-term trust.

## Background and Regulatory Context

Vietnam's fintech explosion, valued at $15.67 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $50.21 billion by 2030 at a 21.48% CAGR, is fueled by 84% smartphone penetration, 32.77 million active e-wallet users, and non-cash transactions rising 56.8% in volume through 2024 [5]. Mobile payments dominate, with QR code transactions surging 170% in volume and value from 2021-2023, and internet/mobile channels growing at 52% and 103.3% annually [5]. MoMo, with 30 million users and a 68% market share in digital wallets, leads this sector, expanding into super apps for payments, insurance, and shopping [6]. However, cyber-fraud restraints, including a -1.3% market impact, threaten growth, especially with rural low financial literacy amplifying risks for inclusion efforts targeting 290 million unbanked in Southeast Asia [7].

Key regulations include Circular 17/2024/TT-NHNN, effective July 1, 2025, mandating biometric verification (facial recognition or fingerprints) for corporate legal representatives to access electronic transactions, with non-compliance suspending services [3]. This extends Decision 2345/QD-NHNN (July 1, 2024), requiring biometrics for individual high-risk transactions over VND 10 million ($393) per transfer or VND 20 million ($785) daily, first-time logins, and international transfers [8]. The July 2025 magnetic stripe ban discontinues all stripe-based transactions, promoting EMV chip cards for encrypted, unique codes per transaction to curb skimming [9]. SBV's cybersecurity mandates under Project 06 aim for a unified digital identity by 2025, deactivating 86 million unverified accounts (43% of 200 million total) by September 30, 2025, achieving 57% compliance but causing exclusion for rural and elderly users [10]. Decree 94/2025/ND-CP launches a fintech sandbox for testing innovations like credit scoring and open APIs, fostering inclusion while ensuring data protection under the upcoming Data Law (2026) [11]. These align with Vietnam's National Digital Transformation Program, targeting $45 billion digital economy by 2025 and $90-200 billion by 2030 [12].

Blind spots include rural areas (62% of population), where low financial literacy and infrastructure gaps hinder adoption, potentially amplifying fraud in MoMo's inclusion initiatives [13]. AI integration could mitigate this, with Vietnam's AI market projected at $1.52 billion by 2030, contributing 12% to GDP [12].

## Effectiveness of Biometric Upgrades in Reducing Fraud

Biometric upgrades, including chip ID and VNeID integration, have proven highly effective in Vietnam's fintech sector, reducing fraud by 50-72% since July 2024 implementation [14]. Mandatory biometrics under Decision 2345/QD-NHNN collected data for 38 million bank accounts and 4 million e-wallets by mid-September 2024, dropping fraud-related accounts by 72% to 682 and money transfer incidents by 50% to 700 cases, while maintaining stable daily transactions at 25 million [15]. Banking fraud causing customer losses fell 50% in August 2024 versus the first seven months' average, with a 72% decline in fraudulent fund-receiving accounts compared to 2023 [16]. SBV reports a 40% overall fraud reduction post-deactivations, with some institutions noting zero cases in August-September 2024 [17]. By August 15, 2025, 120.9 million individual and 1.2 million organizational records were validated, yielding a 59% drop in individual fraud and 52% in illicit fund accounts [18].

Integrations like NFC chip-based 12-digit IDs (replacing expired 9-digit cards post-December 31, 2024) and Level 2 VNeID apps enable real-time verification against the National Population Database, improving accuracy by 41% at Techcombank and reducing suspicious activities by 63% at Vietcombank [19]. For high-risk transactions, biometrics combine with additional checks, addressing low NFC success rates noted at Vietnam Banks Association conferences [20]. From January 1, 2025, unverified accounts limit to in-person transactions, with a new circular replacing Circular 35/2016/TT-NHNN expected in October 2024 to bolster internet banking [21].

### Case Studies from Peers like ZaloPay

Specific ZaloPay case studies are limited, but sector-wide impacts apply, as ZaloPay operates under the same SBV mandates [22]. General e-wallet fraud reductions of 50-72% post-biometrics include ZaloPay, with stable transaction volumes indicating no disruption [15]. Cake Digital Bank, a peer, achieved ISO/IEC 30107-3 Level 2 certification for facial authentication and liveness detection, enabling 2-minute credit approvals and zero fraud in pilots [23]. RCBC in the Philippines (regional parallel) used AI-biometrics for dynamic compliance, reducing false positives and shifting to event-triggered reviews [24]. MoMo's iProov integration mirrors this, verifying live presence against deepfakes, potentially achieving similar 40-63% reductions [25]. These cases demonstrate biometrics' role in sustaining 97-98% digital transactions while cutting fraud [26].

## AI Applications in Real-Time Risk Assessment

AI enhances real-time fraud detection in Vietnam's fintech, with Visa's $3 billion investment over the last decade powering models that prevented $27 billion in fraud in 2022 via Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA) [27]. In Southeast Asia, pilots like United Overseas Bank's Tookitaki AI solution prioritize alerts and detect unknown patterns, reducing false positives by 60% and adapting to threats like phishing [28]. SymphonyAI reports only 24.6% of ASEAN institutions actively use AI for AML, but 41% plan adoption, focusing on transaction monitoring amid a 64% money laundering surge (2018-2023) [29]. Vietnam's banks, including Vietcombank's VCB Digibot (handling 88% queries for 50,000+ monthly users), use AI for eKYC (128-criteria facial recognition at TPBank) and fraud detection, cutting transaction times by 30% and manual workloads by 40% [30].

MoMo leverages AI via its partnership with iProov for Dynamic Liveness, integrating facial biometrics with AI to counter deepfakes, aligning with SBV mandates [25]. Regional pilots prevent phishing/deepfakes, with Sumsub's liveness detection reducing risks by 30% in onboarding [31]. AI agents forecast behaviors, with 95% accuracy in anomaly detection, saving $12 billion annually globally [32]. In Vietnam, AI could yield 7-9% cost reductions and 9% revenue growth by 2027, per BCG, through automation in payments and lending [33]. SE Asia's AI uplift to GDP is 10-18% ($1 trillion by 2030), with Vietnam's cybersecurity market growing from $220.8 million (2025) to $358.1 million (2029) [12].

## Compliance Costs and User Adoption Rates

Compliance with SBV mandates involves significant costs for technology upgrades, training, and maintenance, though exact figures are qualitative. Implementation challenges include integrating legacy systems (affecting 60% of institutions), data quality issues, and high upfront expenses for NFC/chip ID and VNeID, estimated at billions regionally but unspecified for Vietnam [34]. Ongoing costs cover server infrastructure, AI model training (80% of development time on data processing), and cybersecurity under Decree 53/2022 and PDP Decree 2023 [12]. Banks like HSBC faced penalties for delays, with proactive investments yielding 22% trust gains [19]. Fintech licensing requires VND 50 billion ($1.96 million) minimum capital, plus security certifications [35]. Vietnam's $25 trillion ($954 million) allocation for digital transformation supports these, but rural barriers add indirect costs via literacy programs [36].

Adoption rates stand at 57% compliance by September 2025, with 108 million individual and 55% corporate accounts verified by May [1]. By August 2025, 120.9 million individuals and 1.2 million organizations complied, but 86 million accounts were deactivated [10]. Globally, 85% of institutions adopt AI-biometrics by 2025, with Vietnam at 94% pursuing AI [32]. Urban areas (45% of transactions) show higher rates (e.g., 87% adult accounts, 91% digital in Hanoi/HCMC), driven by 84% smartphone penetration [5]. Rural adoption lags due to low literacy (73.7% seek education), infrastructure gaps, and elderly exclusion, with only 47% low-income banked vs. 97% high-income [37]. Surveys indicate 46% see FinTech expanding access, but 51% report speed issues; 62% merchants note higher returns with digital tools [38]. Strategies include in-app literacy (23% preference) and partnerships like MoMo's incentives [39].

### Urban vs. Rural Segmentation

Urban centers like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi exhibit 91% Millennial/Gen Z adoption for payments/lending, with 97-98% digital transactions and 80% mobile wallet use [26]. Rural areas (62% population) face -0.9% impact from literacy gaps, with 81% middle-income banked but only 34% using mobile money; unbanked cite mistrust (13.2%) and fees (6%) [37]. Biometrics amplify exclusion without smartphones, but initiatives like VNeID pilots aim for 80-90% adult adoption by 2030 [9]. MoMo targets rural via super app features, boosting inclusion for 290 million SE Asia unbanked [6].

## Emerging Threats and Regulatory Data Management Priorities

Emerging threats include AI agents in fraud, with KPMG's H1 2025 Pulse of Fintech reporting $44.7 billion global investment but rising AI-linked scams; APAC deepfake fraud surged 1500% in 2023, causing $485.6 billion losses [40]. In Vietnam, AI deepfakes bypassed selfies, with $39 million laundered via spoofed biometrics in May 2025 [41]. Phishing emails rose 341% in six months, with 76% organizations hit; BEC caused $2.9 billion losses [42]. KPMG notes AI for synthetic identities and $688 billion APAC fraud in 2024, with 58% banks investing in detection [43].

SBV priorities emphasize data management via Circular 17/2024's reporting mandates, connecting to monitoring systems for AML and fraud prevention [10]. Decree 94/2025 sandbox tests data sharing, with Data Law (2026) restricting cross-border transfers [23]. Project 06 centralizes biometrics, but privacy risks from breaches and surveillance persist [15]. Regulations like Decree 163 modernize telecom data, with NAIO for AI ethics [44].
