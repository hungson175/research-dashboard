# Opportunities and Risks in Financial Inclusion via Non-Traditional Credit Scoring for MoMo in Vietnam

## Executive Summary

AI-based credit scoring using alternative data sources, such as transaction history and mobile usage patterns, presents significant opportunities for MoMo to expand financial services to Vietnam's unbanked population, aligning with the national goal of 80% financial inclusion by 2030. Vietnam's fintech market, valued at USD 33.9 billion in 2023 and projected to reach USD 72.74 billion by 2029, is driven by innovations like the regulatory sandbox introduced under Decree No. 94/2025/ND-CP, effective July 1, 2025, which enables testing of AI credit scoring for underserved segments including SMEs and rural users.[1] Regional benchmarks from Indonesia and the Philippines demonstrate successful implementations that have boosted loan access for underbanked groups, with applicability to Vietnam's Mekong Delta through mobile-first strategies. However, ethical risks such as algorithmic bias and privacy concerns, coupled with regulatory requirements from the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) on data consent and Credit Information Center (CIC) reporting, necessitate robust mitigation strategies. For MoMo, which holds a leading 23-68% market share in e-wallets with 31 million users, integrating AI credit tools could drive 20-30% growth in unbanked segments via embedded lending and partnerships, while enhancing its 64% P2P transaction dominance. This report explores these dynamics, projecting scalable models and risk frameworks to support MoMo's strategic role in Vietnam's digital transformation.

## Background and Strategic Context

Vietnam's push for financial inclusion targets 80% adult access to formal financial services by 2030, amid Southeast Asia's 290 million unbanked individuals and a regional fintech ecosystem generating 65% of digital finance revenue through AI innovations.[2] MoMo, as Vietnam's premier mobile wallet, aligns with this mission by facilitating payments, remittances, and emerging lending services in a market valued at USD 782 million in 2024, forecasted to grow to USD 12 billion by 2033.[3] The National Digital Transformation Program and initiatives like eKYC and VietQR have propelled non-cash transactions to grow 52% annually from 2021-2023, reducing cash circulation from 12.11% to 9.98% by April 2024.[4] Yet, challenges persist: only 56% of adults have bank accounts (below the SEA average of 81%), with rural literacy gaps and data deficiencies hindering credit access for SMEs and youth in areas like the Mekong Delta.[5]

Non-traditional credit scoring addresses these gaps by leveraging alternative data—such as MoMo's transaction histories, social metrics, and telco patterns—to assess creditworthiness for first-time borrowers without formal histories. Fintechs like FinVolution exemplify this regionally, using AI to bridge inclusion barriers. For MoMo, with partnerships across over 50 banks and a recent AI Awards 2025 recognition as a leader, this technology could embed lending into its ecosystem, supporting P2P/B2B transactions (64% P2P share) and fostering trust amid government targets for 70% digital banking by 2030.[6] However, low rural financial literacy (affecting 62% of the population) and P2P restrictions pose hurdles, emphasizing the need for ethical, compliant models to avoid bias and erosion of user trust.[4]

## Sandbox Pilots for Credit Scoring Using Non-Traditional Data

Vietnam's regulatory sandbox, established by Decree No. 94/2025/ND-CP on April 29, 2025, and effective July 1, 2025, provides a controlled environment for testing AI-based credit scoring with alternative data, supervised by the SBV.[1][7] This two-year pilot (extendable by two one-year periods) targets innovations for financial inclusion, excluding P2P lenders but allowing credit institutions and eligible fintechs like MoMo to participate. Eligible solutions include credit scoring using non-traditional sources such as mobile usage, e-commerce history, and transaction data to evaluate SMEs and unbanked individuals, integrated with CIC data for enhanced accuracy.[8]

Objectives focus on banking modernization, risk-benefit evaluation with limited customer exposure, and legal framework refinement, without supplanting existing regulations on AML, cybersecurity, and data privacy.[1] Participants must submit dossiers detailing business plans, risk management, and pilot strategies; evaluation criteria emphasize innovation, capacity, consumer benefits, and market readiness. For credit scoring, pilots must demonstrate added value for underserved users, with operations confined to Vietnam and no cross-border activities.[7] SBV oversight includes periodic reporting, inspections, and revocation for non-compliance or stability risks.[8]

As of September 30, 2025, the sandbox is newly implemented, with no completed pilots reported for AI credit scoring outcomes.[1] Pre-2025 efforts by fintechs like MoMo and VNPAY involved alternative data for inclusion, but lacked sandbox structure; for instance, mobile wallets tested transaction-based assessments informally.[9] Potential outcomes for first-time borrowers include faster approvals (seconds to minutes) and lower defaults via predictive models, mirroring global Gini coefficients of 0.40-0.50 (70-75% accuracy) versus traditional 62-65%.[10] Early participation could enable MoMo to pilot embedded lending, projecting scalable access for 20-30% more unbanked users by integrating wallet data with Open APIs under Circular No. 64/2024/TT-NHNN.[1] Challenges include ensuring data consent and bias mitigation, with SBV emphasizing compliance to align with the 80% inclusion target.[4]

## Regional Benchmarks from Indonesia and the Philippines and Applicability to Vietnam

Southeast Asian neighbors offer proven benchmarks for AI credit scoring's impact on inclusion, particularly in rural and unbanked segments, adaptable to Vietnam's context.

### Benchmarks in Indonesia
Indonesia, with 70% unbanked/underbanked and only 12.7% MSME bank credit access in 2021, has leveraged alternative data for rural inclusion.[11] Bank BRI's AI models using agricultural data (crop yields, market prices) via apps like Pinang and Ceria processed over USD 8 million in microloans for rural borrowers, reducing processing from two weeks to two days and fraud by 40%.[12] Kredivo's platform analyzes e-commerce behavior and mobile data, approving loans for 2 million users (20% monthly growth for no-history individuals), achieving 90% on-time payments and disbursals up to IDR 30 million in two minutes.[12] These initiatives, supported by OJK Regulation No. 3/2024, boosted financial literacy from baseline levels and MSME lending, with machine learning complementing human assessments to minimize biases.[11] Outcomes include enhanced predictive accuracy (up to 20% over traditional models) and inclusion for gig workers in informal economies.[13]

### Benchmarks in the Philippines
The Philippines, where 50.2% of adults had accounts in 2024 (World Bank Global Findex), uses telco and e-commerce data for underbanked access.[14] Tonik Bank's partnership with FinScore scored 15 million accounts using 400+ signals, disbursing USD 500 million in loans to 3.5 million Filipinos, including rural feature-phone users.[12][15] Trusting Social's AI platform, compliant with the Data Privacy Act 2012, enabled USD 500 million in unsecured portfolios for 1 million monthly borrowers, raising approval rates for women and lowering interest via anonymized telco data.[16] JuanScore's models, covering 77% of underserved populations, employ deep learning for real-time decisions, aligning with the NSFI 2022-2028 and increasing literacy by 85% in targeted segments.[17] These efforts reduced defaults and fostered entrepreneurship, with AI market growth from USD 79.38 million in 2024 to USD 3.48 billion by 2030.[15]

### Applicability to Vietnam's Rural Segments
These models are highly applicable to Vietnam's Mekong Delta and rural areas, where 62% face literacy barriers and infrastructure gaps mirror Indonesia's informal sectors.[4] Mobile penetration (over 130 million subscriptions) enables telco/transaction data use, similar to BRI's rural apps, for MoMo's 31 million users.[18] Vietnam's 70% unbanked rate and USD 20.3 billion MSME credit gap parallel regional challenges, with sandbox pilots adaptable via partnerships (e.g., MoMo-Viettel for telco data).[10] Localized adaptations include gender-sensitive scoring like UnionBank's to address biases, and mobile-first strategies for low-literacy users, potentially lifting inclusion to 80.2% Asia-wide by 2030.[19] Challenges like data privacy (PDPA-inspired) and infrastructure require SBV-guided integrations, projecting 20-30% unbanked growth for MoMo through embedded tools.[12]

## Ethical and Regulatory Risks

### Regulatory Framework and SBV Guidelines
SBV guidelines under Decree 94 mandate data consent for alternative sources in credit scoring, requiring explicit user approval for Open APIs and prohibiting sensitive data (e.g., health, social media without minimization).[1][7] CIC reporting obligations classify NPLs into five groups (e.g., Group 5 for >360-day overdue, restricting loans for two years), ensuring accuracy via independent IT systems and excluding transaction histories.[20][21] Loan limits apply in P2P (max two-year terms, domestic transfers), with SBV enforcing AML and cybersecurity compliance; violations lead to revocation.[8] The sandbox evaluates bias mitigation, demanding robust risk plans and consumer protection.[1]

### Ethical Risks: Bias, Privacy, and Consent
Algorithmic opacity risks embedding biases, such as gender disparities (e.g., 13.5% TPR difference reduced to 4.7% via reweighing), disadvantaging women and rural users in low-literacy contexts.[22] Privacy threats from "all data is credit data" approaches erode autonomy, with breaches like the 2019 MSB incident (2 million accounts) highlighting vulnerabilities in Vietnam's 50th-ranked cybersecurity.[10][11] Consent issues arise in informal economies, where nudging via scores could mimic surveillance, absent comprehensive laws beyond the 2015 Cyber-Information Security Law.[9] Ethical concerns include disparate impacts on minorities, with studies showing mobile/social data predicting defaults better but risking exclusion if datasets underrepresent groups.[11]

### Mitigation Strategies
Amendments to credit laws (e.g., Circular 39/2016/TT) should ban discriminatory proxies, mandate explanations/appeals, and enforce audits, drawing from EU AI Act and US FCRA.[7][9] Privacy reforms via data minimization and differential privacy (e.g., ε=10 for fairness) balance innovation with protection.[22] SBV-led ethical AI guidelines—emphasizing transparency, fairness, non-maleficence—via ad hoc committees and sandbox testing can mitigate risks, fostering trust and compliance for 80% inclusion.[10] For MoMo, partnering with CIC for accurate reporting and bias audits ensures equitable models, avoiding trust erosion in rural segments.[4]

## Impact on MoMo's P2P/B2B Transactions and Partnerships

MoMo's ecosystem, with 64% P2P share and USD 40.5 billion in mobile payments (2024), stands to benefit from AI credit scoring by enabling embedded lending for unbanked users.[3][23] As the top e-wallet (23-68% market share, 31 million users, 140,000 payment points), MoMo's AI recognition at the 2025 Awards positions it for sandbox participation, using transaction/social data to offer instant loans up to VND 30 million.[2][6] This could boost P2P/B2B volumes (e.g., remittances via Western Union partnership, projected USD 19.56 billion inflows in 2023) by 20-30%, targeting SMEs/youth in the Mekong Delta.[1][24]

Partnerships with 50+ banks (e.g., VPBank-Shopee BNPL, TPBank postpaid) facilitate Open Banking for alternative data sharing, integrating CIC for loan limits and reducing defaults (1% like MYBank's model).[4][12] P2P restrictions (Vietnamese ownership, no foreign capital for operators) limit full expansion but allow MoMo as an intermediary via e-wallets, enhancing B2B for MSMEs (45% GDP contribution).[8][4] Risks include bias in transaction data eroding trust, but mitigations like consent protocols and literacy campaigns (73.7% users seeking education) support growth to 47.3% market share by 2030.[1][4] Overall, this fosters MoMo's role in 80.2% Asia inclusion, projecting USD 290 billion digital payments by 2030.[4][19]

## Expected Insights: Scalable Models, Projections, and Risk Mitigation

A scalable AI credit model for MoMo involves hybrid systems (traditional + alternative data) like Timo Bank's social/transaction analysis, targeting 5 million new gig worker customers in three years.[12] Projections: 20-30% unbanked growth via 90% mobile penetration, mirroring Tonik's USD 500 million disbursals, with 57% YoY loan increases like Grab Financial.[12][15] Risk strategies include SBV sandbox compliance (consent, CIC integration), ethical audits for bias (reducing disparities to 4.7%), and privacy via differential techniques, ensuring 70% digital transactions by 2030.[1][22] This positions MoMo as a inclusion leader, balancing innovation with regulatory alignment for sustainable expansion.
