# Competitive Dynamics from Super-App Expansion and Cross-Border QR Interoperability: Threats to MoMo and Strategies for Regional Growth

## Executive Summary

Vietnam's mobile payments market, valued at USD 47.56 billion in 2025, is projected to reach USD 76.04 billion by 2030, growing at a 9.84% CAGR, driven by remote payments (69.36% share), QR codes (55.41% mode share), and government mandates for 80% cashless public services by 2030 [1]. MoMo maintains strong dominance with 68% e-wallet market share, 73 million users, and 61.77% retail end-user penetration, processing 5.5 billion transactions in Q1 2025 alone [1][2]. However, super-app expansions by GrabPay and ShopeePay pose significant threats through bundled services like BNPL and e-commerce integration, potentially eroding MoMo's P2P and retail volumes by 20-30% if unaddressed, especially in urban hubs like Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Hanoi, which account for 45% of transactions [1][3]. Cross-border QR interoperability, effective from 2025 with Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, and Laos, could fragment the market further via low-fee regional flows, but also offers MoMo opportunities to capture ASEAN transaction volumes through API integrations.

Regulatory enablers under the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), including VietQR standardization and e-wallet legalization in July 2025, support growth with minimal cross-border fees (under 0.5% projected impact), though barriers like cyber-fraud (e.g., BianLian trojan affecting 12,000 accounts) and rural literacy gaps persist [1][4]. User behavior data reveals high youth loyalty (70% under 40, 88% prefer cashless), influenced by emotional and monetary values, but low switching costs in a fragmented ecosystem heighten risks [5]. Benchmarking scenarios project MoMo maintaining 35-40% share via interoperability strategies, with QR enhancements yielding 15-20% ROI through 20-30% transaction value boosts. Recommended actions include partnerships with NAPAS for cross-border QR and BNPL integrations to position MoMo as an ASEAN hub.

## 1. Overview of Vietnam's Mobile Payments Market

Vietnam's mobile payments ecosystem is rapidly evolving into a cashless powerhouse, fueled by 86.97% bank account penetration, 84 million smartphone users, and 78.9 million internet users as of early 2025 [6]. The market's USD 47.56 billion valuation in 2025 reflects a shift from cash dominance (90% in 2019) to digital (65% online, 46% offline transactions in 2024), with POS volumes at USD 184 billion and e-commerce at USD 24 billion [7]. Remote payments lead with 69.36% share, while proximity payments grow at 13.85% CAGR, supported by NFC infrastructure and Apple Pay's 2024 launch, achieving 75% contactless Visa penetration [1]. QR codes dominate modes at 55.41%, processing over 100 million transactions monthly via VietQR, with the QR payments sub-market expanding from USD 180 million in 2024 to USD 523.28 million by 2032 at 14.27% CAGR [8].

End-user segmentation shows retail and consumer goods at 61.77%, utilities/public services growing fastest at 12.43% CAGR, and P2P transactions at 64.82% [1]. Urban centers like HCMC and Hanoi drive 45% of value through 5G rollouts and super-app adoption, while rural areas advance via Mobile Money pilots targeting the 13.03% unbanked, though financial literacy gaps limit adoption to 27% cash preference [1][7]. The competitive landscape is moderately fragmented, with MoMo leading at 68% e-wallet share and 31 million active users, followed by ZaloPay (53%), ViettelPay (27%), ShopeePay (25%), VNPay (16%), and GrabPay (7%) [2][9]. E-commerce surge (USD 18.2 billion in 2024, 73% via mobile wallets) and super-app bundling amplify growth, but restraints like cyber-fraud (34% YoY spike in Q1 2025) and high fees (-0.50% impact) pose challenges [1]. Biometric authentication has reduced fraud by 57%, bolstering trust amid 73% youth (under 40) driving 88% cashless preferences [5][6].

## 2. Threats from Super-App Expansions

Super-apps like Grab and Shopee are intensifying competition by bundling payments with e-commerce, ride-hailing, and BNPL, eroding standalone wallets like MoMo through seamless integrations and user acquisition tactics. GrabPay, post-Moca shutdown in July 2024, shifted to partnerships with MoMo and ZaloPay but retains 7% share via 'Grow with Grab' initiatives, targeting SMBs with webstore builders and 83% GrabPay activation rates [10][11]. ShopeePay leverages Sea Group's ecosystem, achieving 25% share through e-commerce dominance (66.7% Q4 2024 GMV) and programs like 'Shopee Enables SMEs,' training 100,000 merchants across 63 provinces by 2025 [12]. These expansions threaten MoMo's 61% retail dominance by capturing high-frequency transactions in bundled services, with BNPL integration boosting average ticket sizes by 20-30% among youth [3][13].

### 2.1 Super-App Strategies in HCMC and Hanoi Hubs

In HCMC and Hanoi, which contribute 45% of transaction value, GrabPay focuses on ride-hailing (55% market share, 77% users booking 3+ times monthly) and embedded finance, partnering with VPBank for BNPL on Grab services and expanding to 500+ merchants via GrabMerchant Commerce for 6x sales growth [10][14]. Post-2024 investments of several hundred million USD, Grab emphasizes AI risk scoring and cross-border expansions, with 54% usage in non-major cities but urban premiums (VND 252,101 monthly car rides in key cities vs. VND 219,518 elsewhere) [3][14]. ShopeePay's strategies include Hanoi's official store launch (Plan 256/KH-UBND, September 2025) for OCOP products, targeting 60% categories by end-2025, and SIP for 350,000 sellers exporting to ASEAN with 20-30% revenue growth [12][15]. In HCMC, ShopeePay bundles with TikTok Shop for social commerce, achieving 80,000 agricultural product sales via KOL livestreams and 30x revenue uplifts for brands [12]. These urban-focused tactics, including BNPL partnerships (e.g., MoMo-Grab for services), embed payments in daily life, drawing youth (70% under 40) via promotions and omnichannel experiences [3][13].

### 2.2 Impact on MoMo's 61% Retail End-User Dominance

Super-app bundling risks 20-30% erosion in MoMo's P2P and retail transactions, as 73% of online values clear via integrated wallets like ShopeePay [1]. GrabPay's post-Moca pivot funneled ride-hailing volumes to competitors, with Grab's 55% ride-share dominance in HCMC/Hanoi capturing 30% of urban mobility payments [14]. ShopeePay's e-commerce integration (45% market share) boosts retention through one-click checkouts and rewards, with BNPL (USD 2.61 billion in 2025, 36.5% growth) appealing to 68% of 25-35-year-olds, overlapping MoMo's youth base [13]. Case studies show ShopeePay's 20-fold revenue increase for craft villages via training, indirectly pressuring MoMo's merchant network (140,000 points) [12]. Without countermeasures, MoMo's Q1 2025 5.5 billion transactions could see 15-25% urban decline by 2027, as super-apps leverage 73% mobile wallet clearance in e-commerce [1][3].

## 3. Impact of Cross-Border QR Interoperability

Cross-border QR linkages, effective 2025 via NAPAS with Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, and Laos, enable low-cost regional flows but risk fragmenting MoMo's USD 47.6 billion market if competitors capture tourist/SME transactions [1][4]. Pilots like Vietnam-Laos (January 2025) and NAPAS-UnionPay MoU (October 2024) process 26 million daily transactions, boosting QR volumes 106.7% YoY [7][16]. This could erode 20-30% of MoMo's P2P/retail share through inbound tourism (17-18 million visitors in 2024) and exports, but interoperability offers MoMo a pathway to ASEAN hub status via local currency settlements [17].

### 3.1 Market Share Shifts in Urban vs. Rural Vietnam Post-2025

Post-2025, urban areas (HCMC/Hanoi, 45% value) face accelerated shifts, with QR interop driving 14.27% CAGR in cross-border volumes, potentially reducing MoMo's 68% share to 50-55% as GrabPay/ShopeePay integrate ASEAN linkages [8][1]. Rural regions, via Mobile Money extensions, see slower adoption (27% cash preference), but pilots could boost volumes 13.85% CAGR, shifting MoMo's rural dominance (30% current) to 40% if unleveraged, amid 30% intermittent access [6][7]. Projections indicate urban erosion of 25% in tourist-heavy transactions, vs. rural stability at 10-15% due to literacy barriers [1].

### 3.2 Transaction Volumes for MoMo vs. Competitors

MoMo leads with 5.5 billion Q1 2025 transactions (64.82% P2P share), but competitors like VNPay (750,000 merchants) and ViettelPay gain via QR (ZaloPay 57% share) [1][2]. Post-interop, volumes could fragment: MoMo's retail GMV (61.77% end-user) risks 20% loss to ShopeePay's e-commerce (USD 24 billion), while GrabPay captures 15% ride-hailing [3][14]. External estimates show MoMo at 47.3% by 2030 vs. ViettelPay 30.2%, but QR could accelerate to 35% for MoMo without strategies [18].

## 4. Regulatory Enablers and Barriers under SBV's Cashless Initiatives

SBV's initiatives, including the 2021-2025 non-cash project (62% annual growth) and Decree 52/2024 (July 2024), legalize e-wallets and mandate VietQR, enabling 80% public services cashless by 2030 [4][19]. Enablers include free fast transfers and NAPAS interoperability, reducing barriers for 87% adult accounts [1]. Barriers encompass fragmented standards (-0.70% impact) and fraud (13,900 cases), with rural gaps (-0.90%) [6].

### 4.1 Fees for Cross-Border QR and Merchant Onboarding Trends

Cross-border fees remain low (under 0.5%, local currency settlements), with NAPAS-Laos linkage (January 2025) enabling seamless flows without high interchange [7][16]. Merchant onboarding grows 1.2% impact via VNPay's 750,000 points and ShopeePay's SME training, but compliance costs pressure small wallets [8][12]. SBV's sandbox and AML Circular 27/2025 enhance security, projecting 50% non-cash e-commerce by 2025 [4][20].

## 5. User Behavior Data on Switching Costs and Loyalty

Youth demographics (70% under 40, 88% cashless preference) drive adoption, with emotional (β=0.306) and monetary values (β=0.318) boosting satisfaction and loyalty (β=0.607) in digital banking [5]. Switching costs mediate (β=0.144) and negatively moderate satisfaction-loyalty (β=-0.065), creating barriers in urban areas but low retention in rural (30% intermittent access) [5][6]. Surveys show 71% weekly e-wallet use, with Gen Z prioritizing incentives (cashback) and integration, but 32% miss BNPL repayments, heightening erosion risks [13]. Loyalty programs grow to USD 971.2 million by 2029 (15.7% CAGR), emphasizing gamification and personalization for 60% urban youth [21].

## 6. Competitive Benchmarking Report with Scenarios

MoMo benchmarks strongly against GrabPay (ride-hailing focus, 7% share) and ShopeePay (e-commerce, 25%), leading in P2P (64.82%) but trailing in bundling [1][2]. Base scenario: Without action, 20-30% erosion to 40-45% share by 2027 via super-app/QR fragmentation [1]. Optimistic: API integrations maintain 35-40% via 15% urban retention [3]. Pessimistic: Rural gaps lead to 30% share if interop favors competitors [7].

| Scenario | Market Share Projection (2030) | Key Assumptions | Transaction Impact |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Base (Status Quo) | 45% | No interop leverage; super-app bundling erodes 25% urban volumes | -20% P2P/retail |
| Optimistic (API/QR Focus) | 40% | Partnerships boost cross-border; youth loyalty via rewards | +15-20% value |
| Pessimistic (Fragmentation) | 30% | High switching; rural unaddressed | -30% overall |

## 7. Strategies for Interoperability to Capture Regional Flows

MoMo should prioritize VietQR/NAPAS integrations for cross-border, partnering with Grab for BNPL and Shopee for e-commerce to counter bundling [1][13]. Expand rural via Mobile Money pilots and youth incentives (AI personalization, cashback) to reduce switching [5]. Projected ROI: QR enhancements yield 15-20% transaction boost (14.27% sub-market CAGR), positioning as ASEAN hub with USD 2.2 billion Vietnam-Laos trade [8][17].

### 7.1 Partnership Opportunities for Cross-Border Expansion

Collaborate with NAPAS for Thailand/Singapore linkages and UnionPay for China (40 million merchants), enabling 20-30% revenue growth like Shopee's SIP [7][12]. BNPL ties with Fundiin/Pharmacity target youth, while telco alliances (VPBank-MobiFone) enhance rural reach [3][13].

### 7.2 Projected ROI on QR Enhancements

Investments in QR (e.g., AI risk scoring) project 15-20% ROI via 106.7% volume surge, offsetting 1.2% onboarding costs with 57% fraud reduction [1][6]. By 2030, this captures 10-15% ASEAN flows, boosting GMV 20% [4].

## Conclusion

Super-app expansions and QR interoperability threaten MoMo's dominance but enable regional capture through proactive strategies. By leveraging SBV enablers, addressing user loyalty, and forming partnerships, MoMo can sustain 35-40% share and achieve 15-20% ROI, solidifying its ASEAN position amid 80% cashless goals.
